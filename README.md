## Plan
- [x] Get route numbers and names from route.txt GTFS file
- [x] Create searchable dropdown
- [X] Create 3 route lists (available, wrong guesses, correct guesses)
- [X] Pick 2 random "correct routes" and get wrong guesses to show up and correct guesses to show up. 
- [X] Send itinerary geojson to S3
- [X] Send origin+destination geojson to S3
- [X] Get origin+destination geojson to show up on map
- [X] Get itinerary geojson to show up on map
- [X] If correct route is selected, show route (no matter the itinerary) on the map 
- [X] If incorrect route is selected, add to bad guesses
- [X] If all routes in an itinerary are selected, reveal itinerary and congratulations messages
