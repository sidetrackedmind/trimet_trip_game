## Plan
- [x] Get route numbers and names from route.txt GTFS file
- [x] Create searchable dropdown
- [ ] Create 3 route lists (available, wrong guesses, correct guesses)
- [ ] Pick 2 random "correct routes" and get wrong guesses to show up and correct guesses to show up. 
- [ ] Send itinerary geojson to S3
- [ ] Get itinerary geojson to show up on map
- [ ] Isolate routes within itineraries into a featuregroup
- [ ] Isolate individual itineraries into a featuregroup
- [ ] If correct route is selected, show route (no matter the itinerary) on the map 
- [ ] If incorrect route is selected, add to bad guesses
- [ ] If all routes in an itinerary are selected, reveal itinerary and congratulations messages
